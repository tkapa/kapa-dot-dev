title: Discord UI in .NET MAUI
excerpt: "Hey, how’s it going! I’m making this post as a part of #MAUIUIJuly, hosted by my colleague[ Matt Goldman](https://mobile.twitter.com/mattgoldman). If you want to see more posts around this topic, take a look [here](https://goforgoldman.com/2022/05/19/maui-ui-july.html)!\n\nExperience level - Beginner\n\nAs a beginner to .NET MAUI myself, there was no better way to force myself to get into the groove by participating in #MAUIUIJuly. Feel free to take a look at the [Github repository](https://github.com/tkapa/MauiUIJuly-Discord-UI) while you read this post.\n\nIt was difficult to decide what I should do , so as per Matt’s suggestion on his blog post, I chose to attempt recreating the UI of an app that I use on the daily! So in this blog post, I’m going to take a shot at a recreating a basic version of [Discord](https://discord.com/)’s UI.\n\nIn creating this mock-up I managed to learn a lot about .NET MAUI, and I was actually pretty impressed that I was able to do this as a side project after work. There were some awesome people on YouTube that helped me learn more, and I’ll share those resources at the end of this post.\n\nFigure: Discord’s existing mobile interface\n\n## WHERE WE START\n\nAs a beginner to .NET MAUI, Discord’s generic chat interface will be a perfect challenge to go about recreating with the time that I’ve allocated.\n\nLet’s break down the parts of the screen we’ll be creating today.\n\n### THE HEADER\n\nOutlined in purple, the header is quite simple. It contains some navigation buttons, a ‘#’ to indicate that we’re inside of a channel, the name of said channel. \n\n### THE CHAT\n\nOutlined in red, we spot a chat message. As a chat application, most of the screen real estate is dedicated to displaying these messages. For each message we have a user, a timestamp and message content. I was most worried about accurately recreating this part of the application.\n\n### &#x20;THE USER INPUT\n\nFinally, in yellow, we have the user input section, where we can send messages, images, gifs and more through the application. We’ve got some input buttons, and a message entry that the user will type their message into.\n\n## HOW WE IMPLEMENT IT\n\nLet’s jump right into our main page and implement the header. This is the part that I finished last, and I learned a good thing or two about Shell along the way. As we go through I set up some basic colours and styling, though I couldn’t manage to find the exact font in time for this submission.\n\n```html\n<!--Header Content-->\r\n<Shell.TitleView>\r\n  <HorizontalStackLayout Padding=\"-15\">\r\n\r\n    <Button BackgroundColor=\"#2F3136\">\r\n                <Button.ImageSource>\r\n                    <FontImageSource\r\n                        FontFamily=\"MaterialIcons\"\r\n                        Glyph=\"{x:Static helpers:MaterialFontHelper.Menu}\" \r\n                        Size=\"25\"\r\n                        Color=\"WhiteSmoke\"/>\r\n                </Button.ImageSource>\r\n            </Button>\r\n\r\n    <Label Text=\"#\"\r\n                   TextColor=\"#99aab5\"\r\n                   FontAttributes=\"Bold\"\r\n                   FontSize=\"20\"\r\n                   VerticalOptions=\"Center\"/>\r\n\r\n    <Label Text=\"general\"\r\n                   TextColor=\"WhiteSmoke\"\r\n                   FontAttributes=\"Bold\"\r\n                   FontSize=\"20\"\r\n                   Padding=\"5\"\r\n                   Margin=\"0,0,190,0\"\r\n                   VerticalOptions=\"Center\"/>\r\n\r\n    <Button BackgroundColor=\"#2F3136\">\r\n                <Button.ImageSource>\r\n                    <FontImageSource\r\n                        FontFamily=\"MaterialIcons\"\r\n                        Glyph=\"{x:Static helpers:MaterialFontHelper.AccountMultiple}\" \r\n                        Size=\"25\"\r\n                        Color=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\r\n                </Button.ImageSource>\r\n            </Button>\r\n\r\n  </HorizontalStackLayout>\r\n</Shell.TitleView>\n```\n"
