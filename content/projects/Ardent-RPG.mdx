Available for Android and iOS, [Ardent RPG](https://ardentroleplay.com/) is one of the first commercial mobile applications that I had the pleasure of working on with Ardacious Pty Ltd. It is an assistant application for tabletop roleplaying games, bringing it to life through the players' screens. I had only a small part in it, working on the project for 3 months.

Created in Unity 3D, I was responsible for graphics programming, creating shader solutions to complex graphical problems. It was an incredible and unique opportunity to work on.
